What I have found over the years is that when people do this, they tend to work in isolation with no objective person to hear them and make sure they use the tools they found. This is why it is so important to have a therapist help you in your process of self-improvement. \n\nSo if you feel overwhelmed or unfulfilled, your online search has brought you to the right place.  I can help you with emotional issues such as self-esteem, depression, anxiety, anger, and stress. I also help you with other areas of your life that become affected by these issues such as relationships, communication, parenting, work or your education. I am comfortable and have experience working with people of all faiths and cultures as well as being an LGBTQQIA (also known as \u0022sexual minority\u0022) affirming therapist. \n\nMy counseling style includes Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and mindfulness to help people make the connection between their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. CBT involves learning about the issues like depression or self-esteem and completing exercises to learn your current mindset and how to change it. Mindfulness is related and is about being aware of yourself and living in the present moment as well as being focused on positive goals. Using these two strategies helps you to stay focused and adds accountability to prevent you from slipping back into old habits. Clients leave sessions with clarity on who they are, what they want, and how to get it, stress-free. My purpose is to help you stop surviving and start living! Still not sure if this is right for you? Take a look at the testimonials below to see what others have said about our work together.\n\nI have over 20 years of experience in social work as a therapist, researcher, teacher, and trainer. I have worked in a variety of settings including inpatient treatment, outpatient treatment, K-12 public schools, as well as colleges and universities. I also founded The SWEET Network, LLC (Supporting Women to Empower and Enhance Themselves): a counseling service that provides individual and couples therapy, specializing in women of color and trauma.\n\nMy goal is to provide you with simple tools to apply to everyday life.","full_name":"Fanteema Barnes-Watson","gender":"female","credentials":["LCSW"],"state":"North Carolina","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":false,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Trauma and abuse","Self esteem","Depression","LGBT","Family conflicts","Grief","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties","Coping with life changes","Compassion fatigue"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":["Family of Origin Issues","Family Problems","Guilt and Shame","Life Purpose","Military and Veterans Issues","Multicultural Concerns","Polyamory \/ Nonmonogamous Relationships","Post-traumatic Stress","Prejudice and Discrimination","Self-Love","Sexual Assault and Abuse","Social Anxiety and Phobia","Women\u0027s Issues","Workplace Issues","Young Adult Issues"],"clinical_approaches":["Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)","Mindfulness Therapy","Trauma-Focused Therapy"],"npi_number":"1093977274","counselor_of_color":true,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Trauma and abuse","Self esteem","Depression"],"secondary":["LGBT","Family conflicts","Grief","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties","Coping with life changes","Compassion fatigue"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LCSW","state":"New Jersey","country":"United States","number":"44SC05669100","expires_at":"2024-08-31"},{"type":"LCSW","state":"New York","country":"United States","number":"083531","expires_at":"2024-05-31"},{"type":"LCSW","state":"North Carolina","country":"United States","number":"C013889","expires_at":"2025-04-30"}],"pretty_license_text":"NC LCSW C013889, NJ LCSW 44SC05669100"},{"id":11,"slug":"dan-kimball","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/ec02d81fd2461a8d26d805d0a07464da.jpg","years_experience":22,"description":"If you are experiencing anxiety, depression, social isolation, relationship issues, or just general life dissatisfaction,  I can help you to get your life back on track.

I am so excited for what the future holds for you by taking this first step.  It takes tremendous courage, but you and your happiness are absolutely worth it!  You deserve to be happy and live a fulfilling life.  I believe that with every ounce of my being. I have made helping people get out of their own way my life\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mission and work, starting with myself.  Know that all of my advice is never something that I have not done for myself.\r\n\r\nLet me start by telling you about myself.  I have been a licensed therapist in MA for the past ten years.  I graduated with my Masters degree in Clinical Behavioral Psychology from UMA of Dartmouth in 2004 and obtained my LMHC in 2006.  I have worked with children and adults, with issues ranging from Anxiety, Depression, ADHD, healing from trauma and adjusting to major life changes.  What I love the most about this work is creating a space that is safe enough for individuals to do the inner work which will lead them to a more fulfilled life.  I believe that therapy can benefit anyone and is not about masking or escaping our emotions. It is about learning how to honor them, and having the tools to navigate through what you are feeling instead of allowing your feelings to control and define who you are.  Only then can we navigate any circumstance that comes into our lives and feel like we are the master of our own fate.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as a wife and mother of two young children, I know the challenges that couples face in transitioning from just the two of you.  Being a mother is the best and hardest thing in my life.  I also know first-hand  the challenges a woman can face in her identity during this very vulnerable time.  Since becoming a mom I have become passionate in helping woman not just regain a sense of who they were, but better yet, create an even greater version of themselves.\r\n\r\nI have also been studying and coaching in motivational psychology for twenty years. Having also been certified in energy medicine, my style is more holistic and spiritual.  I have found, that one of the commonalities that my clients possess is the inability in the present moment to fully and unconditionally love and accept themselves.  That, in my opinion, is one of the most difficult things to learn how to do.  But, the most important to learn if we are to live the life that we so desire and deserve for ourselves.  I use many approaches and customize your treatment plan to what will work for you and your specific situation.  I respect how much courage it takes to start or continue this journey.  But, I wholeheartedly believe that investing the time to take care of ourselves in this way is the most worthwhile thing we can do for ourselves and the ones we love.  I feel so very honored to be able to do this work and never take for granted the trust that is created in the therapeutic relationship.

If you are spending more time thinking of getting out, than actually relating, you might want to take that seriously.  Another diagnostic question concerns your core values.  Does this other person\/partner really reflect and agree with your core values  going forward  or is a great part of the relationship experienced as ambivalent?

And your life needs to be based on good decisions.\r\n\r\n I utilize Jungian Depth Psychology as well as current Solution-based approaches,  and when applicable, Dream Amplification. Many people find their dreams a source of guidance and a legitimate tool, especially with the help of a trained therapist, during crises, arriving at crossroads, and illness, separations and break-ups.  Everyone dreams in 90 minute cycles through the night (although drugs can interrupt these cycles) and understanding the real guidance offered is one of the primary tools for trusting the self.\r\n  \r\n While I am very interested in the source of a person\u0027s suffering, I look at what the person is doing now, at the present moment, which keeps the old, outdated responses in place.  I will try many things to help a client and, at some point, I do expect some change to occur, even if reflected in just a small, but pivotal step  Change can sometimes happen remarkably quickly;  other times it takes awhile, and patience is required.\r\n\r\n Most of us would agree that standing at that\u0022 fork in the road\u0022 too long can bring more depression and confusion than was bargained for.  I would like to help you create the freedom which comes from carefully listening to yourself,  reframing your feelings and styles of reacting, then taking the steps which feel comfortable to you to get you to a place of well-being and confidence. It always makes a difference to have a non-judgmental and patient person on your side, until you can be non-judgmental and patient with yourself.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. C.G. Jung:  \u0022My own understanding is the sole treasure I possess, and the greatest.\u0022\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\n\r\nRobin Campbell, \r\nL.P.C\/Depth Psychotherapist","full_name":"Sheri Campbell","gender":"female","credentials":["M.Ed","LPC"],"state":"Texas","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":true,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Self esteem","Bipolar disorder","Coping with life changes","Family conflicts","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Sleeping disorders","Career difficulties","Depression","Compassion fatigue"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":["Codependency","Communication Problems","Dependent Personality","Emptiness","Forgiveness","Life Purpose"],"clinical_approaches":["Imago Relationship Therapy","Jungian Therapy","Mindfulness Therapy","Solution-Focused Therapy"],"npi_number":"1578895215","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Self esteem","Bipolar disorder","Coping with life changes"],"secondary":["Family conflicts","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Sleeping disorders","Career difficulties","Depression","Compassion fatigue"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LPC","state":"Texas","country":"United States","number":"9578","expires_at":"2025-04-30"}],"pretty_license_text":"TX LPC 9578"},{"id":281,"slug":null,"photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/3954cf089bab8378f2fe48344a9d3dd0.jpg","years_experience":12,"description":"Sharon Adams, MSW, LCSW received her master\u0027s degree from Indiana University where her concentration was in mental health and addictions.

I\u0027ve worked with individuals, couples, children, and families of diverse backgrounds in many different settings, with many different issues.    Specialties include work with depression,  anxiety,  trauma, abuse, and family issues.   I\u0027ve also worked with addictions, sex offenders, kids of all ages, employee assistance, and just about anything else you can imagine, or so it seems.    After all these years I \u0027m tempted to say I\u0027ve \u0022heard it all\u0022... until something new proves me wrong!   \r\n\r\nWhat I can say is I will  try to offer a realistic perspective to almost any problem, whether it\u0027s a parenting, relationship, or family issue, or if you need help overcoming your fear, anxiety, anger, hurt, or just plain crazy-off-the-wall-stressful lifestyle.   I draw upon many schools of thought, including cognitive-behavioral therapy, reality therapy, structural family therapy, and various trauma-informed approaches.   For those who request Christian Counseling, I have a seminary education and can provide Biblical insights into all of the above, but also acknowledge that the church is made up of imperfect people and sometimes brings wounds of its own.  \r\n\r\nSo whatever your background, I believe it\u0027s important to be real, to meet you where you are, and work together to find the best solutions.  If you need someone to discuss the complex bio-psycho-social dynamics and treatment protocols for particular diagnosis, I can do that.   If you need someone to break down the psychobabble into plain language, I can do that.  If you need it explained by chapter and verse, or want nothing to do with religion, that\u0027s fine too.  Most of all, I believe that everyone deserves to be heard with compassion and respect before I can earn the right offer advice, challenge your thinking, or confront you with an uncomfortable truth.  \r\n\r\nOne of things I love  about Betterhelp is that I have the opportunity to work with people from all over the world, and am reminded daily that the things we have in common are far greater than anything that may separate us.   So no matter what your background, I am honored to have the privilege of getting to know you, and will do everything I can to help.\r\n\r\nHope to meet  you soon!\r\n\r\nCathy\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nFor more details on my professional experience and education, please see my Linked In page at https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/catherinemisciagna, or my private practice website at www.CounselorCathy.com","full_name":"Catherine Misciagna","gender":"female","credentials":["MA","LPC"],"state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":true,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Parenting issues","Depression","Addictions","Relationship issues","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Anger management","Self esteem","Bipolar disorder","Coping with life changes","Compassion fatigue"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":["Abandonment","Adoption and Foster Care","Blended Family Issues","Caregiver Issues and Stress","Co-morbidity","Codependency","Commitment Issues","Communication Problems","Control Issues","Coping with Natural or Human-Caused Disaster","Dependent Personality","Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD)","Dissociation","Divorce and Separation","Domestic Violence","Drug and Alcohol Addiction","Emptiness","Expats","Family of Origin Issues","Family Problems","Fertility Issues","First Responder Issues","Forgiveness","Guilt and Shame","Hoarding","Hospice and End of Life Counseling","Impulsivity","Infidelity","Intellectual Disability","Isolation\/Loneliness","Jealousy","Life Purpose","Midlife Crisis","Money and Financial Issues","Mood Disorders","Narcissism","Obsessions, Compulsions, and OCD","Panic Disorder and Panic Attacks","Paranoia","Phobias","Postpartum Depression","Post-traumatic Stress","Pregnancy and Childbirth","Process addiction (porn, exercise, gambling)","Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)","Self-Harm","Self-Love","Sex Addiction","Sexual Assault and Abuse","Social Anxiety and Phobia","Somatization","Traumatic Brain Injury","Trichotillomania","Visually Impaired","Women\u0027s Issues","Workplace Issues","Young Adult Issues"],"clinical_approaches":["Client-Centered Therapy","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)","Existential Therapy","Motivational Interviewing","Solution-Focused Therapy","Trauma-Focused Therapy"],"npi_number":"1104140904","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Parenting issues","Depression"],"secondary":["Addictions","Relationship issues","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Anger management","Self esteem","Bipolar disorder","Coping with life changes","Compassion fatigue"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LPC","state":"Pennsylvania","country":"United States","number":"PC005432","expires_at":"2025-02-28"}],"pretty_license_text":"PA LPC PC005432"},{"id":422,"slug":"caitlin-adair","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/507553680bb99b567f105e36acd2a368.jpg","years_experience":5,"description":"I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in the states of Pennsylvania and Delaware.

I am located in Florida where I began my career in counseling in 1994 as a residential therapist in a psychiatric hospital, followed by the roles of an outpatient therapist, clinical supervisor and program director at a substance abuse treatment agency. In 2001, I relocated to Ohio, where I worked for the next 13 years as a Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor - Supervisor, program manager and program administrator for a mental and behavioral health nonprofit organization. In 2014, I relocated back to Florida where I began my online practice. If you have any reservations about online counseling, I encourage you to give it a try. It is a highly effective and convenient therapeutic modality that can be accessed from the the comfort and safety of your own home or wherever you are at any given time. I can attest to this with utmost confidence based on my clients\u0027 positive feedback after providing services here for over 8 years. \n\nMy clinical philosophy is one of a humanistic nature, with emphasis on the therapeutic relationship as the most essential building block of the counseling process. My therapeutic style is warm, interactive, attentive and compassionate. I believe that genuineness, unconditional positive regard and empathy are critical to the helping process. As needed, I am also direct and structured in my approach and tend to assign therapeutic homework or tasks to enhance the progression and continuity of the process in between live sessions or message exchanges. I have the ability to tailor and pace treatment to your individual and unique needs, and I am sensitive to evolving the process at your pace and convenience while still promoting and prompting advancement toward your goals. Furthermore, I take a holistic approach to health and wellness, with emphasis on achieving balance in major life domains. I believe that when needs, desires or aspirations are unfulfilled in one significant realm, the others are affected as well and this creates imbalance in one\u0027s life, leading to stress, anxiety, inconsistency, overwhelmed feelings, lack of self-care, somatic symptoms, etc. Lastly, in terms of professional characteristics and standards of care, I operate with the highest degree. I was esteemed throughout my career for my level of professionalism, ethical conduct, organization, efficiency and grace. \n\nMy educational background includes: a bachelor\u0027s degree in psychology from University of Miami, FL; a master\u0027s degree in mental health counseling from Nova Southeastern University of Fort Lauderdale, FL; and additional post-graduate coursework in career counseling, and the diagnosis, evaluation and treatment of mental disorders at University of Dayton in Bexley, OH. I enjoy the ongoing pursuit of continued education, training and professional development through seminars in specialized areas, reading and self-study. I highly value knowledge, information and effective application of therapeutic theories, models, strategies, and techniques that may benefit the people I serve. \n\nMy clinical experience includes working with various diverse populations and treatment modalities, and the full spectrum of issues and disorders ranging from the most simple to the most complex co-occurring conditions. I specialize in treating depression\/anxiety\/stress, substance abuse\/addiction, emotional\/physical\/sexual abuse, trauma and grief\/loss. I also have extensive experience with counseling issues in the following areas: LGBT, Relationship issues, Family conflicts, Intimacy-related issues, Parenting issues, Anger management, Self esteem, Career difficulties, Compassion fatigue \u0026 Addictions in general.\n\nDepression, anxiety and stress are some of the most common challenges faced by people who seek counseling. In this realm, I have worked with children, adolescents and adults in residential\/hospital, outpatient and community-based settings. I have provided individual, group and family services, and have facilitated psycho-educational counseling groups and workshops on coping skills, stress management\/reduction, emotion regulation, self-esteem and assertive communication skills. My approach though eclectic, tends to be rooted in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which per evidence-based research, is very effective in treating these issues. This active intervention is problem-focused and goal-directed in examining the relationships between thoughts, feelings and behaviors; and modifying unhelpful or negative patterns of thinking that lead to self-defeating beliefs and actions, to improve coping and overall wellness. I also take a mindfulness-based approach to CBT (MBCBT) by encouraging the use of mindfulness practice and self-compassion. These tools help to address and validate one\u0027s personal experience with distress, pain and suffering; and diminish associated negative symptoms by focusing attention on the present moment. Learning how to self-soothe and regulate emotions through effective relaxation, calming and grounding strategies are significant components of my clinical approach to addressing depression, anxiety and stress. \n\nFor over two decades, I have treated teens and adults who struggle with substance abuse and dependency issues. In 1998, I was humbly honored to receive Florida Alcohol \u0026 Drug Abuse Association\u0027s Professional of the Year award. I have provided these services in various settings and levels of care from the least to the most restrictive. As an outpatient alcohol and drug counselor, I worked with self-referred individuals as well as those who had been mandated to receive evaluation and\/or treatment as a condition of probation, parole, work, school or a family\/community member. I provided these services in individual, group and family forums. As a clinical supervisor and administrator, I had the opportunity to develop and oversee programming and staff in the specialized area of addictions. In a training capacity, I facilitated seminars to educate clinical staff in the areas of assessing, diagnosing and treating alcohol and drug problems. I am very passionate about working with people who struggle with addictions in general, one day at a time, toward a healthy recovery and lifestyle. Maintaining a strong emphasis on healthy coping skills, positive support systems and relapse prevention planning are key to my treatment approach in this area. \n\nIn the delicate area of treating the effects of abuse and trauma, I have worked with child and adult survivors of emotional\/physical\/sexual abuse and violence. I have extensive experience working with acute and post traumatic stress disorder and have developed and facilitated group curricula that focus on reducing isolation, guilt\/shame and self-blame; building self-esteem, positive support systems and coping skills; and increasing a sense of mastery and personal empowerment. I am also well versed at teaching survivors how to implement effective relaxation, grounding and anchoring techniques to help diminish anxiety and maintain a balanced state of arousal and focus in the present moment. Encouraging self-forgiveness is also very important to me in helping survivors let go of illegitimate shame or guilt derived from any unwanted responses to, or effects from the abuse. Throughout the healing journey, I am sensitive to guiding the process at a pace that feels most comfortable and safe to each person, and promoting respite from focusing on difficult material if\/when it becomes too emotionally burdensome. To help prevent any inadvertent re-traumatization from occurring during the counseling process, I am especially conscientious and attentive to providing trauma-informed care. \n\nThroughout my career, I have helped children, teens and families work through grief\/loss challenges. In my professional opinion, there is no one particular formula for grieving. Though there are common elements or phases of grief, everyone grieves differently. It is a very personal experience and individual response to coping with significant loss of any kind - death, separation\/divorce, relocation, retirement, job loss\/change, etc. Grief occurs in stages, which may come like waves in the ocean, ascending and receding at any given time and in no particular order. I am skilled at helping people understand this phenomenon and learn how to navigate these treacherous waters. I have expertise in providing compassionate support and effective strategies to aid individuals through this vulnerable and difficult time toward a place of healing and acceptance. \n\nWorking with LGBTQIA+ counseling issues is a point of passion for me. I respect, admire, embrace and promote diversity, individuality and authenticity in my personal and professional life. I am LGBTQIA+ informed\/educated and have experience with bullying, coming out, internalized homophobia, gender identity affirmation and transgender support. Mental health problems are difficult enough in their own respect, let alone compounded by LGBTQ issues. I have worked with a broad spectrum of concerns in this realm ranging from depression, anxiety, shame, guilt, secrecy and confusion associated with sexual orientation\/attraction and gender identity to homo\/bi\/transphobia and HOCD (homophobic obsessive compulsive disorder). Furthermore, LGBTQIA+ couples and families have unique issues when it comes to navigating the legal, emotional and financial aspects of raising and\/or restructuring a non-traditional family. On behalf of this community, I firmly believe that more support, education and advocacy are greatly needed. With all the significant strides that have been made toward raised awareness and acceptance in our society, there is so much more that we can do to achieve full empowerment and equality for all. I want to be a part of this valuable movement and growth journey by helping one individual at a time. \n\nI genuinely admire your initiative and courage to reach out for support, and look forward to working together toward your goals. With patience and commitment and dedication to this process, this is the first step toward a happier and healthier or more evolved you.\n\n","full_name":"Kara Anderson","gender":"female","credentials":["MS","LMHC","PCC-S"],"state":"Florida","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":true,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Addictions","Relationship issues","Trauma and abuse","Grief","LGBT","Family conflicts","Intimacy-related issues","Parenting issues","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Depression","Coping with life changes","Coaching","Compassion fatigue","ADHD"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":["Blended Family Issues","Body Image","Caregiver Issues and Stress","Chronic Pain Illness and Disability","Codependency","Communication Problems","Divorce and Separation","Drug and Alcohol Addiction","Eating and Food-Related Issues","Family of Origin Issues","Family Problems","Forgiveness","Gender Dysphoria","Guilt and Shame","Life Purpose","Multicultural Concerns","Polyamory \/ Nonmonogamous Relationships","Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)","Self-Love","Sex Addiction","Sexual Assault and Abuse","Sexuality","Social Anxiety and Phobia","Women\u0027s Issues","Workplace Issues","Young Adult Issues"],"clinical_approaches":["Client-Centered Therapy","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)","Mindfulness Therapy","Motivational Interviewing","Narrative Therapy","Psychodynamic Therapy","Solution-Focused Therapy","Trauma-Focused Therapy","Internal Family Systems"],"npi_number":"1437718467","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Addictions","Relationship issues","Trauma and abuse","Grief"],"secondary":["LGBT","Family conflicts","Intimacy-related issues","Parenting issues","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Depression","Coping with life changes","Coaching","Compassion fatigue","ADHD"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LMHC","state":"Florida","country":"United States","number":"MH5069","expires_at":"2025-03-31"},{"type":"LPCC","state":"Ohio","country":"United States","number":"E.0500133-SUPV","expires_at":"2023-09-21"}],"pretty_license_text":"FL LMHC MH5069, OH LPCC E.0500133-SUPV"},{"id":438,"slug":"tim-crosby","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/677daa3a217baf80fb57e7dfcb7788d1.jpg","years_experience":10,"description":"I am a marriage and family therapist licensed in California, and I have over 10 years of experience as a psychotherapist.

You made it!  That first step of asking for help can be a tough one!  I congratulate you on your courage.  Many people never take that step and suffer needlessly. \r\n\r\nWhat\u0027s causing you pain right now?  Panic attacks?  Depression?  Fear? I understand.  When stress gets too high, it has to show up somewhere and often these are the ways it shows up.  If you\u0027ve been struggling to just get through your day, you know the pain of NOT doing something about it.  It\u0027s likely affecting your confidence, your relationships, your work or school.  It doesn\u0027t have to be that way!  It\u0027s possible to live a life without constant fear and fatigue.  I specialize in working with women with anxiety, depression and low self esteem.\r\n\r\nAnxiety can be a general sense of uneasiness all the way to having obsessions and compulsions to full blown panic attacks.  The fear that overwhelms you with anxiety feels very dangerous, but it\u0027s not.  It\u0027s really your mind and body trying to cope with life from a very primitive level--fight or flight.  But it makes you exhausted, unable to concentrate, isolated, and can even land you in the emergency room with what feels very much like a heart attack.  How would your life be different if anxiety was no longer scaring you?  \r\n\r\nDepression can be mild (everyday feeling low, having little motivation) to moderate (skipping work because you just can\u0027t get going in the morning, canceling events because nothing sounds like fun anymore) to severe (thoughts of ending your own life because life has lost all joy and you can\u0027t get out of bed, nor do you want to).  If your depression is severe, you need counseling in a safe setting, maybe a hospital, or several times a week in a counselor\u0027s office.  But if you fit mild to moderate, this may be a good place for you to get help.  I have been helping women cope with depression for more than 30 years and I would be honored to help you.  Please don\u0027t give up!  You can have a great life!  I challenge you to imagine a life free from depression...\r\n\r\nMaybe you\u0027re just trying to sort out some big life situations, like making decisions about your relationships or coping with the empty nest issue.  Maybe your grown kids are causing you some pain.  I have three grown kids with kids of their own. I get it.  I can help.  \r\n\r\nIf you\u0027ve grown up in a home that hasn\u0027t taught you how incredible you are, or you\u0027ve been through some challenging relationships in which you\u0027ve been emotionally beaten down,  you may be suffering with low self-esteem.  This is a very real issue, and not at all uncommon in women.  I watch women every day in my practice gain strength and courage and confidence.  They begin challenging those lies they\u0027ve been fed and start spending time with people who support them and lift them up.  It\u0027s an amazing transformation!  This could be YOU!\r\n\r\nOh, and for reassurance, I am a Florida Licensed Mental Health Counselor with a private practice in Orlando, Florida.  I graduated from University of Central Florida with both my undergraduate psychology degree and my master\u0027s degree in Counselor Education.  I started practicing counseling in the early 1980s and have loved it ever since then :-)  My reward is your healing!  \r\n\r\nAs a strong Christian, I have many online clients whom I get to help seek God\u0027s wisdom as the main basis for their healing.  I\u0027m a leader in my church; I am a volunteer and facilitate a small group.   If you\u0027re wanting your counseling to line up with God\u0027s word, I can help!\r\n\r\nDon\u0027t suffer any longer.  Give this a try.  I look forward to hearing from you. \r\nConnie","full_name":"Connie Branham","gender":"female","credentials":["MA","LMHC"],"state":"Florida","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":true,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Family conflicts","Self esteem","Depression","Trauma and abuse","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":"1619182359","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Family conflicts","Self esteem","Depression"],"secondary":["Trauma and abuse","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LMHC","state":"Florida","country":"United States","number":"MH3357","expires_at":"2025-03-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"FL LMHC MH3357"},{"id":472,"slug":"ruth-vanden-bosch","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/8de41c0d461fc9d4155d82c9c3e698f2.jpg","years_experience":23,"description":"I am a Licensed Professional Counselor, Life Coach, and Registered Nurse licensed in Michigan, a Nationally Certified Counselor, and a member of the American Counseling Association. and the Michigan Counseling Association.

Thank you for looking at my profile. \r\n\r\nBefore I tell you about my experience and education, I would like to tell you a little bit about my approaches to counseling. First and foremost, please know that your healing and your journey is important to me. Therefore, along the way I will ask you if my approaches are working for you and if you are comfortable with them. I will also welcome your feedback at any time as well. That being said, I am trained in both traditional and non-traditional counseling techniques. I like to use both. I am formally trained in Client Centered ( Carl Rogers ) techniques. These techniques are designed to help you feel heard and have your feelings validated. Please know that you deserve this. I also have training in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which focuses on ways in which your thinking may be causing you stress\/distress. \r\n\r\nI love a holistic approach to therapy, therefore, I received extra training in the Expressive Arts. This may sound scary to those of you who are not artists, but being an artist has nothing to do with expressive art. Expressive art is a means of expressing yourself and discovering your true inner feelings, inner voice and inner power. Instead of just talking about your issues\/concerns, I would encourage you to draw them, paint them,  dance them out, write them out,. etc.  Whatever feels comfortable for you. The whole point of these modalities, is to move blocked energy (issues) out of your body which holds memory. Memories are not just stored in your brain. The body remembers and the body reacts. Especially to trauma. But you don\u0027t have to have been traumatized to benefit from these techniques. Expressive Art can help you with self esteem issues, depression, anxiety, motivation, life decisions, career choices, eating disorders and sleeping problems. No one ever has to see your artwork or see you move in an expressive and meaningful way. \r\n\r\nIdeally, I like to combine both traditional therapies with some form of the Expressive Arts.  They reinforce each other.  But, ultimately, it is up to you and what works best for you.  I also like to teach various powerful visualizations.\r\n\r\nI received my Master of Education in Mental Health Counseling from Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts in January of 2001. I became licensed in 2007. I received a Certificate in The Facilitation of Expressive Arts from Salve Regina University in Newport, Rhode Island in 2007. I have over 17 years of experience working with both men and women and with families and children of all ages.  \r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you. \r\nThank you and Namaste, (the spirit in me honors the spirit in you)\r\nCindy","full_name":"Cynthia Robinson","gender":"female","credentials":["M.Ed.","LMHC"],"state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":false,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Trauma and abuse","Self esteem","Depression","Grief","Sleeping disorders","Career difficulties","Coping with life changes","Compassion fatigue"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":["Guilt and Shame","Isolation\/Loneliness","Life Purpose","Panic Disorder and Panic Attacks","Self-Love","Social Anxiety and Phobia"],"clinical_approaches":["Client-Centered Therapy","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)","Mindfulness Therapy","Narrative Therapy","Solution-Focused Therapy","Somatic Therapy","Trauma-Focused Therapy"],"npi_number":"1497709299","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Trauma and abuse","Self esteem","Depression"],"secondary":["Grief","Sleeping disorders","Career difficulties","Coping with life changes","Compassion fatigue"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LMHC","state":"Massachusetts","country":"United States","number":"5992","expires_at":"2023-12-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"MA LMHC 5992"},{"id":575,"slug":"keri-kitchen","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/a0200348419642a7ae8df292a5151308.jpg","years_experience":12,"description":"I earned a Master of Education in Mental Health Counseling and Human Development from Lindsey Wilson School of Professional Counseling in 2008. My experience has been in a range of settings, but primarily in working with individuals and families to explore anxiety, depression, or other underlying concerns that create problems in day-to-day life. I have experience and training working with anxiety and depression, grief\/bereavement, perinatal mental health, trauma, parenting, and more. \r\n\r\n    Throughout my schooling and career, I have had many professional influences, through professors, supervisors, colleagues, and various theorists. Theoretically, I find myself often focusing on a cognitive-behavioral approach to therapy. Ultimately, I view the theories and techniques I use through a scriptural and spiritual framework, always striving to better understand God\u0027s remarkable creations. \r\n\r\n    I believe that the counseling process revolves around improving relationships with others as well as the self. Life is a learning process.  My basic approach is generally to help my subscribers develop and master healthy coping skills (building confidence in their ability to do so), and then work together to dig a bit further to identify and resolve underlying conflicts that lead to common symptoms (such as anger, anxiety, and depression). It\u0027s a process with different pieces, and when they all start fitting together, very good things can happen. Counseling is work - it requires effort on both the part of the therapist and the part of the subscriber... but the end result can be life changing!

In that setting I have learned a lot of crisis intervention skills and adjustment problem coping skills as people generally go through a period of crisis while trying to adjust to a new illness and all that can go along with that.  I have also been in private practice since 2007 and the bulk of my patients suffer with anxiety disorders (panic attacks, social anxiety, phobias, etc.); Depression\/Bipolar disorder; Eating disorders; Relationship struggles; Anger, OCD and couples counseling.\r\n\r\nI have a Masters in Social Work and a clinical license in Social Work which allows me to be in private practice.  I also have gone through a lot of training on Mindfulness (Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction course) where I have learned how to practice mindfulness and meditation to name a few.  It is a very powerful coping tool but not everyone is open to it.  Therefore I am use CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) along with a Strengths Perspective.  Using the CBT allows us to understand how our thoughts affect how we feel and then how we behave, which can also be enlightening.  The Strengths Perspective gets us in touch with a person\u0027s strengths, because regardless of what we are dealing with we all have strengths and using them to build upon in the spirit of solving the problem @ hand.  Sometimes we arent even aware of the skills we already have or how to use them to help ourselves in our current state.  My approach can also be a combination of what is listed above but the most important way to help someone is to listen and then be able to understand\/diagnose the problem clearly because we cant solve a problem without knowing what it truly is.  \r\n\r\nI believe we all have the ability to embrace change when we are ready and truly enjoy helping people along that journey!","full_name":"Michelle Castellani","gender":"female","credentials":["MSW","LCSW","CEAP"],"state":"New Jersey","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":false,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Family conflicts","Grief","Eating disorders","Addictions","LGBT","Relationship issues","Trauma and abuse","Intimacy-related issues","Sleeping disorders","Parenting issues","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder","Depression"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":"1053401976","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Family conflicts","Grief","Eating disorders"],"secondary":["Addictions","LGBT","Relationship issues","Trauma and abuse","Intimacy-related issues","Sleeping disorders","Parenting issues","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder","Depression"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LCSW","state":"New Jersey","country":"United States","number":"44SC05295300","expires_at":"2024-08-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"NJ LCSW 44SC05295300"},{"id":580,"slug":"jill-ortolano","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/be4f7be67a9c4384d78deb99fea2de97.jpg","years_experience":17,"description":"Hi I\u0027m Jill, a Mental Health Counselor licensed in Massachusetts with 16 years experience.

Searching for a therapist is a big decision and maybe you\u2019ve reached the point where you realize you can\u2019t do it alone, and need support to work through the frustrations, challenges and struggles you are facing in your life right now. \r\n\r\nAs you read my profile, you\u2019ll notice my professional experience spans over 20 years and my training background covers a wide range of diverse topics. My clinical approach combines psycho-dynamic as well as other modalities like DBT, and systems theory to insure you have access to the most update-to-date information available. While adhering to confidentiality, ethical and legal standards, the individualized treatment approach I employ draws from the latest evidence-based practices, emphasizing a supportive insight-oriented, practical and common sense, straightforward style.  I am committed to building an honest, respectful and collaborative alliance with you, to develop a sustainable capacity for continued trust and effective skill building.\r\n\r\nI make every effort to balance ego and humility, and pride myself on being honest, direct, and non-judgmental so you know you are believed, taken seriously, feel valued, and know you matter.  It entails establishing boundaries, and striking a balance between recognizing the impact of confusion, anguish, conflict, suffering and turmoil to acknowledging and benefiting from understanding, insight\/education, advice and feedback. The bottom line is; you gain the tools and coping skills necessary to regulate emotions, become mindful and insure that you gain confidence and competence in your ability to achieve a sense of personal safety, security and stability. \r\n\r\nMy areas of expertise include working with diverse, multicultural clients including both Native American and Native Alaskan populations. I have worked in private practice, created an outpatient clinic providing DBT groups for both men and women diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. I was the clinical director of a medical behavioral health setting focusing on chronic illness, a homeless shelter providing mental health, substance abuse and HIV+ AIDS treatment services, an all-men\u2019s dual diagnosed residential program, a trauma informed treatment program in the 56 Yupik villages of Alaska, a recidivism re-entry program for ex-offenders from San Quentin and Folsom State Prisons.  I also worked in the 1st hospice in the United States, providing death and dignity counseling services to terminally ill patients and bereavement counseling for families.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, my focus is on, although not limited to, working with individuals living with depression, anxiety stemming from trauma histories, recovering from traumatic bonding\/narcissistic abuse, and adults on the autistic spectrum who desire a need to understand Asperger\u2019s and the impact it has on their lives and relationships.  Also, treatment services for the LGBTQIA community; individuals with a wide range of concerns about sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual fluidity, the coming- out stages, intimacy social stigma, family\/relationship conflict, parenting issues, employment concerns and advocacy approaches for the human rights campaign for civil rights. Most importantly, I am passionate about addressing visible, and invisible disability issues, the neuro-diversity of ADD\/ADHD, Dyslexia, and the need to address the fundamental issues of disability rights, learning styles, inclusiveness, ableism, workplace bullying and the impact of internalized oppression.   \r\n\r\nWhat does this all mean for you? I would like to think, it demonstrates my competence and gives you some degree of confidence in my ability to help you achieve greater resiliency, authenticity, and happiness in your life.  Chances are you are doing the best you can and you can do better. That\u0027s where your ingenuity, willingness, motivation, and commitment come into play. There are lots of reasons for you to consider entertaining the thought of on-line therapy. It is an effective way to navigate through your problems on your timetable, and support really makes a difference. It gives you the opportunity to start an action plan, get the help you need to stay on track, follow through and meet your goals consistently. It\u0027s also an emotional tune-up, putting energy and enthusiasm back into your life, so you are empowered to face reality, generate options, problem-solve, let go of the past and take the risks necessary to move forward. Putting the brakes on wishing things were different, you can break through your fears, self-sabotage, addictions, anger issues and codependency in order to set healthy boundaries and discover what it takes to stand up for yourself, say no, protect your own self-interest and become mindful. \r\n\r\nExpand your capacity for recognizing the importance of TFK - thinking, feelings, and knowing, the pillars of EI, emotional intelligence. By increasing emotional self-regulation, interrupting escalating patterns of RUI, reactivity, urgency and intensity, you will be able to manage triggers which will help you respond more calmly, giving you the ability to take on and accomplish the daily challenges with poise while not allowing the past to dictate your responses. \r\n\r\nJust think of that, being grounded and thriving, instead of simply surviving. Sounds simple, it\u0027s not nor do I pretend it is.  Practice makes progress, there is no perfection. Successes and setbacks are inevitable, so it\u0027s one step at a time. Call it an incremental manageable approach to deal with getting impatient, bored, or overwhelmed. It\u2019s not unusual for clients, maybe you included, to feel emotionally vulnerable, fragile, stuck, discouraged, helpless, hopeless and struggling with life-defeating behaviors or suicidal ideation. Regardless of the reasons you seek therapy, it is imperative that you feel understood, supported and can speak freely in order to benefit from the therapeutic experience so you can connect, learn, share, grow and pay it forward.  \r\n\r\nEverything is connected by chains of events, coupled with your vulnerabilities, temperament, and your life experiences while your identity is formed by both narratives, both internal and external. Perhaps it\u0027s time you learned to see yourself through kinder eyes, to look at the world from a more neutral stance, recognize that co-perspectives exist, repair and rebuild in some instances vs. re-enacting and repeating, that way, you can accept  consequences gracefully, cultivate a willingness to wait, tread softly, play by the rules, make lemonade from lemons, advocate for living, confront and process  guilt and shame and recognize that there is no point going to an empty well and expecting water.    \r\n\r\nAccessing online therapy is safe, secure, convenient, confidential, and cost effective.  Keep in mind, you can work on understanding your underlying core issues, the impact of trauma, connecting the historical dots of your life, develop a mental health recovery plan, increase focus, concentration, motivation, and simply live without the drama and recurring crisis.  Dramatically improve your ability to think and feel more positive and hopeful.  It\u0027s like a long awaited of breath of fresh air!  Instead of being on automatic pilot, you take ownership of your choices by being accountable and responsible, both deliberate, and intentional. Benefit from a trusting relationship with me, built on a foundation of mutual respect that gives you the best chance at personal growth and enhancing your own functioning.

It was the very first time I ever felt safe. Since then I\u0027ve gone on to receive my PhD in Mental Health Counseling and a degree in Hypnotherapy. I completed my internship at a women\u0027s residential substance abuse facility assisting women to increase their self-esteem, self-worth, self-image, process their trauma and grief, manage their anxiety and depression, and taught various life skills. I then went on to work in an out-patient substance abuse facility with clients struggling with addiction, trauma, rejection, comorbidity (two or more diagnoses i.e. anxiety, depression, bipolar, or substance abuse, etc), and feelings of worthlessness. I\u0027ve also worked in conjunction with the Division of Family and Children Services to help families regain custody of their children, facilitate adoptions, and counsel children in foster homes and in group homes.  \n\nI authored From Foster Care to FABULOUS: An Imperative Movement, Maximize Your Super Powers \u0026 6 Steps to 6 Figures; co-authored Ripping Gripping Fear Out of Your Story, have several other e-books on Amazon as a result of my own life experiences, and completed rigorous research on the protective factors that evolved foster children into healthy and effective adults. Having grown up in the foster care system myself, I struggled with my own challenges ranging from being controlled by fear to overcoming abusive relationships and self-medicating. I believe it is in the transparency of my personal challenges and triumphs that I am solidified as  an effective therapist, not solely by my PhD. \n\nAs a mental health therapist, public speaker, and life coach (see client feedback at www.capricruz.com), I\u0027ve assisted thousands of clients in achieving greater awareness of their mind, body, and spirit connection, assisted in identifying the root of their challenges in order to regain personal power through solidifying their desired identity, created action plans to self-correct and resolve inner-conflicts, and helped my clients to identify and achieve their life goals. \n\nMy therapeutic approaches include, but are not limited to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Trauma-Focused CBT, Psychodynamic Therapy, Solution-Focused Brief Therapy, Hypnotherapy, Narrative Therapy, Family Systems, Guided Imagery, Stress Reduction, Positive Psychology, and Neuro-Linguistic Programming. \n\nAs a mental health therapist what I\u0027ve learned is that my greatest gift to my clients is to be non-judgmental in my listening in order to help facilitate healing. I believe people want, and often need, to be heard, validated, cared for, accepted, and assisted with feedback. I believe my clients are the experts of their own lives; and I am their guide. Together we are a team. My job is to provide a safe and trusting environment that will help bring that awareness and confidence into their consciousness to empower their ability to meet their own needs.","full_name":"Dr. Capri Cruz","gender":"female","credentials":["LPC"],"state":"Florida","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":false,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Grief","Self esteem","Depression","Coping with life changes","Addictions","Relationship issues","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":"1578919007","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Grief","Self esteem","Depression","Coping with life changes"],"secondary":["Addictions","Relationship issues","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LPC","state":"Georgia","country":"United States","number":"LPC008771","expires_at":"2024-09-30"},{"type":"LPCC","state":"California","country":"United States","number":"7086","expires_at":"2023-09-30"},{"type":"LMHC","state":"Florida","country":"United States","number":"MH17905","expires_at":"2025-03-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"FL LMHC MH17905, GA LPC LPC008771"},{"id":686,"slug":"dawn-bilings","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/b8a19dae5ef8e44c52722174a6343c89.jpg","years_experience":15,"description":"      Howdy there.

I work with clients to enhance self-awareness, insight, and skill sets for managing life. Our therapeutic experience will be a joint effort in reaching your goals! I work with adult couples struggling in their relationships, communication, and living styles over all stages of life. I work with children and teens in their social, emotional, educational, and family systems. I see adults attempting to clarify and reach life goals involving education, work, independence, esteem, and healthy relationships.\nMy formal training is in psycho-dynamic therapy and object relations but I also received a specialized cognitive-behavioral training through The University of Pennsylvania and The University of Colorado. I have developed a combination of being able to work with and understand behaviors and thoughts, but also deeper set feelings and patterns.\nI have an intuitive combination of understanding how people learn and feel, to empower them to identify the direction in which they need to go. I am extremely collaborative and offer useful feedback while respecting the growth and change process. I offer an extremely nonjudgmental and safe environment with which to explore those areas people often cannot.\nPart of the reason I became a therapist was because after having experienced many major life events both as a child and an adult, it empowered me to understand, empathize, and guide others in their psychological growth. I genuinely look forward to working with clients and bearing witness to their story. I am married and have two children. I enjoy reading, gardening, music, yoga\/walking, nature, and films. \n\nThank you!

You are making a commitment to enter into a challenging and life-affirming process of healing and self-discovery.\r\n \r\nWhether you have been struggling with emotional pain in your personal life or conflict within your relationships, counseling can provide the opportunity to voice your concerns, develop your strengths, deepen your intimacy with others, and embrace your vulnerabilities with confidence. Meanwhile, the therapeutic relationship can offer a source of reflective and validating feedback within the context of a safe, present-centered, and grounding environment. As we work together to define the goals of treatment, the ultimate aim of counseling is to experience a life worth living.\r\n\r\nI have received extensive training and as a provider of dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), a treatment of choice for individuals who have experienced trauma, struggle with self-acceptance, and have difficulty managing stress, maintaining emotional balance, and sustaining meaningful relationships.

I have worked with a diverse range of clients and I approach each individual with an open-minded and compassionate spirit. My true passion is connecting with others and helping them learn to connect not only with themselves but also with the important people in their life. \r\n\r\nI obtained my Master\u0027s degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006, and I have been a practicing therapist in and around the Philadelphia area since that time. The first job I took was working in the field of addictions. At that time I primarily utilized the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) model, which has become recognized as an extremely popular and effective type of therapy. After my work in addictions I began to work with families and learned a new model of therapy, a family-systems perspective called Eco-Systemic Structural Family Therapy. This model of therapy really gets to the heart of relationship issues, whether between family members or in any type of interpersonal relationship.  \r\n\r\nCurrently, I have my own office in Philadelphia wherein I see individuals, couples, and families. I help individuals work through depression, anxiety, and stress, while also helping them develop stronger interpersonal relationships. I work with couples and families to understand each other and improve their relationships. I believe my combination of CBT and family-systems therapy is extremely effective in helping people first understand themselves, then develop the ability to help themselves and to improve their relationships.  Recently, I completed training in Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction through the University of Pennsylvania, which has been an amazing tool not only for my practice but for my own personal health. Since completing this program I have been teaching clients how to use mindfulness to help with everything from listening to coping with trauma symptoms. \r\n\r\nLearn more about me on my website:  http:\/\/alexishansen.wix.com\/therapy and make sure to check out my GoodTherapy.org page to read some of the articles published on their blog. \r\n\r\nTherapy can seem like a scary or intimidating journey to begin.

Secondly, I help clients gain the self-awareness and skills to make better choices and solve problems.  Third, I help clients accept what they cannot change and be at peace with who they are.\r\n\r\nOne of my main tools is empathy.  I really strive to see things from my client\u0027s perspective.  Also, every client is unique, so I am very flexible and skilled in several therapeutic disciplines.  My focus is to use therapeutic interventions that work best for the client.\r\n\r\nWhile clients generally see me for mental health and other related issues, I enjoy helping people work through relationship problems, and take a special interest in clients undergoing a faith, spiritual, or existential crisis.  \r\n\r\nI am available to see you via the Better Help website or my own practice at www.cobehavioralhealth.com.\r\n\r\nExperience:\r\nAnalyst and project director for a mental health and substance abuse program evaluation firm- 3 years\r\nTherapist and case manager for clients suffering from severe and persistent mental illness, substance abuse, and trauma- 2.5 years\r\nOutpatient therapist\/clinical social worker with Michigan Department of Corrections- almost one year\r\nTherapist in private practice- 1.5 years\r\n\r\nEducation\r\nMasters of Public Administration- Grand Valley State University\r\nMasters of Social Work- Grand Valley State University\r\n\r\nLicense- Licensed Masters Social Worker (LMSW)","full_name":"Christopher Ostrander","gender":"male","credentials":["LMSW"],"state":"Michigan","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":true,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Trauma and abuse","Intimacy-related issues","Anger management","Addictions","Relationship issues","Family conflicts","Grief","Parenting issues","Self esteem","Bipolar disorder"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":null,"counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Trauma and abuse","Intimacy-related issues","Anger management"],"secondary":["Addictions","Relationship issues","Family conflicts","Grief","Parenting issues","Self esteem","Bipolar disorder"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LMSW","state":"Michigan","country":"United States","number":"6801094958","expires_at":"2025-06-23"}],"pretty_license_text":"MI LMSW 6801094958"},{"id":1425,"slug":"rick-jackson","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/073575086f6176059f07fc4cc1b32f0b.jpg","years_experience":8,"description":"I am a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker in Minnesota.

I have several years of experience helping individuals and families resolve issues that may cause distress or conflict. My primary work experience has involved providing individual and family counseling to those affected by substance abuse, depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. I believe that all individuals experience trials and tribulations in life that tax their natural abilities to cope. \r\n\r\nI see counseling as an opportunity to tackle those trials and tribulations with accompanying positive support and encouragement. Sometimes we really need to hear things from other people and that helps us propel our lives in a positive direction. Other times, we just need to feel supported along our journeys. Regardless of the circumstances, I believe that both therapist and client can come to grow and appreciate one another through the experience of supportive counseling. \r\n\r\nMy theoretical orientation consists primarily of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques and a specific expressive therapy often referred to as play therapy. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy teaches us to note our dialogue and the way in which it influences our feelings and actions. Many times our moods or behaviors are often influenced by the perspective that we take on a situation. Our perspectives are then what will guide how we feel and act.   Play therapy provides a means to explore issues that doesn\u0027t involve coming up with the \u0022right words,\u0022 but rather provides an opportunity to further explore issues and concerns. \r\n\r\nSeeking help for problems that we may have is not easy, but seeking help is the best course for change.

I am an active-duty Navy spouse and Mom and understand the stress involved with living a military life, whether it\u0027s deployments or long hours or simply being on-call 24\/7.  I have had the opportunity to volunteer with spouses that struggle with the military life, and normalizing some of the problems that arise is very fulfilling.\r\n\r\nI want to let you know about some of the work that I\u0027ve done and loved over the last twelve years. \r\n\r\nI originally started working with high risk children in NC, but this position ended after 10 months as I left the position due to a personal choice to leave the state.\r\nWorking with high-risk children was a difficult position.  The children that I saw were all seen for state mandated therapy in my office and brought by either parents or agency sponsors.  I did a lot of art based therapy with these children as I did not get much if any access to the parents for parental guidance.  I helped the children work on self-esteem and self reliance in addition to doing regular abuse screenings.  Moving forward to 2012-2015....the past three years have been at my private practice.  I have worked more with families than children individually.  I have worked on developing and maintaining good parenting skills and maintaining good boundaries and limits.  Some families really appreciated the \u0022Magic 123\u0022approach.  Where others preferred individual plans that worked for their individual families (whether it be a family with a child on the spectrum that required time lines and consistency or twins with ADHD that used behavior modification charts with motivating factors dictating the modifications and of course consistency).\r\n\r\nFrom 2015-2017 I was blessed to have obtained a job as the Regional Director of a community center in Jacksonville, NC.  I was able to use my skills and experience to supervise young and new Social Workers and LPC\u0027s.  I was able to network with the local community and grow the small business into a budding program with immense potential.  When my family and I left the NC area I was proud to have been a part of this growing community center and knew that I was leaving the families, children, and the community in a healthier place than when I started.  \r\n\r\nI did work for a short period in and inpatient adult psychiatric unit and after only a short time I knew that this was not my calling.   After my inpatient high-risk psychiatric experience I went back to my roots which I found while attending Baylor University and working on my MSW.  While I was in school was when grief and bereavement became my clinical and academic focus.  I have always had a passion for those experiencing loss.  My internships were with a local hospice in Mexia, TX and another specialty clinic in Waco, TX that worked exclusively with Alzheimer\u0027s patients.  I did my master\u0027s thesis on Alzheimer\u0027s and sensory therapy.  \r\nAlzheimer\u0027s disease is a very difficult disease to help people through because the caregiver and the patient need two totally different things.  The caregiver is dealing with premature loss and anticipatory grief while the patient is dealing with reminiscent therapy and often sensory therapy.  \r\n\r\nI moved to Baltimore Maryland and started my work at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center @ Johns Hopkins Hospital and loved every minute I was there in oncology.  My specialties were gastro-intestinal cancers and melanoma.  I sat weekly on the tumor boards for the weekly reviewed cases and had the privilege of working with the families that were chosen for treatment.  I met them on their first day and stayed with these families until death or discharge of treatment.    I had the honor to present more than on grand rounds (one on Ethics and the other one \u0022Difficult Families\u0022).  Being able to have a part in any of my families journeys was a privilege.  These families allowed me to guide them on one of the most personal losses in life the death of a loved one.  Grief and bereavement have always been close to me and my practice and I encourage any survivors to thrive not simply survive and am willing to work on that concept with clients. \r\nDuring my private practice work I rely heavily on solution focused approaches and my therapy is very narrative in nature and requires work from not only me, but mostly the client.  I do use cognitive behavioral techniques when appropriate, but I am not afraid of delving into any theory or technique that I believe will assist the client.\r\nI have surprisingly enjoyed working with couples.  Couples (in my experience) tend to have a different kind of motivation for change.  They are either more willing to work or they come in already being finished (in which case they don\u0027t stay long).  I believe in teaching my couples not only how to hear but to listen.  Empathy and validation are constant focuses in regards to my couples. \r\n\r\nAs far as my individual work with those experiencing anxiety or depression the idea is to focus more on what is causing the problems\/anxieties than it is to focus on the physical aspects of the depression and anxiety.  I as the therapist know and can see that you are depressed or anxious, and the physical manifestations that these diagnoses are creating, but my job is to isolate the \u0022why?\u0022 and help to work you through the trigger.  I do not hesitate to recommend seeing an MD when I recognize that talk-therapy is not where a client needs to start.   \r\n\r\nI love what I do and my job is something that look forward to every day.  I would be happy and it would be a privilege to help and assist in any way possible.","full_name":"Sharon Szalejko","gender":"female","credentials":["BA","MSW","LCSW-C"],"state":"North Carolina","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":true,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Grief","Parenting issues","LGBT","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Intimacy-related issues","Eating disorders","Sleeping disorders","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder","Depression"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":"1427399385","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Grief","Parenting issues"],"secondary":["LGBT","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Intimacy-related issues","Eating disorders","Sleeping disorders","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder","Depression"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LCSW-C","state":"Maryland","country":"United States","number":"14010","expires_at":"2024-10-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"MD LCSW-C 14010"},{"id":2020,"slug":"kelli-prisbe","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/c7ff80f88f13c3f778e12e33cd89053c.jpg","years_experience":0,"description":"I believe that all people are intelligent and capable of helping themselves.

Over the past 20 years as a clinician, my experience has taught me that the most important aspect of counseling by far is the connection and comfort you feel with the person you choose to share your personal struggles.   I believe we can all grow through challenging experiences by increasing our self-awareness.  Sometimes another person, one who isn\u0027t in our immediate circle, can offer a perspective or additional support, that give us movement on a difficult situation when we feel stuck.  It would be my privilege to be that person for you.  We all want to be able to share our personal truths and be accepted and understood.  I believe it\u0027s very important to be open-minded and non-judgmental when someone shares their personal story or experiences with me.   Our relationship with our self and others has worth and is useful to explore in counseling.\n\nYou are welcome to message me anytime through Better Help.  The frequency with which you can have access to a counselor to work through day to day emotions and problem solving is extremely beneficial for most and a nice change from traditional outpatient counseling.

I like to help my clients gain insight about themselves and others, assist them through the healing process, and then help them get back on track with their lives.

I offer my clients my genuine concern and empathy, combined with my direct thoughts, insights, and recommendations. I can offer you a safe place to sort through what is on your mind and heart. Many people carry a heavy load emotionally and fear letting their guard down with others. One of the benefits of therapy is that I am not in your every day life.

I can help you cut through the noise and get to the root of what is truly troubling you and I can walk you through the steps necessary to bring about the change you desire to see in your life.  \r\n\r\nCounseling Experience:\r\n-20+ years as a Counselor\r\n-Private practice for 10+ years (individual, marital, adolescent, \u0026 family counseling)\r\nProvided counseling services for individuals and families of all ages, while assisting with difficulties in areas like: marriage, divorce, blended family concerns, coparenting with an ex-spouse, recovering after a divorce, parenting children at various life stages, establishing healthy boundaries with others, grief and loss, depression, anxiety, spiritual concerns, decision making, addictions (self or others), and hurts from the past.\r\n-Served as counselor in a variety of agency settings for 13 years -  I have extensive history and knowledge of the adoption process.

I have worked with people with issues\r\nranging from anxiety and depression to grief and trauma to relationship and career difficulties and many more.\r\n\r\nI use a variety of different therapy approaches and believe that the relationship between therapist and client is highly predictive of success. I tailor my approach to each client\u0027s unique needs but some of the most common techniques I use are Solution Focused Therapy, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, DBT, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, EMDR, Exposure and Response Prevention Therapy and Psychodynamic and Attachment Based therapies. \r\n\r\nWhat would be important for someone to know about working with you?\r\n\r\nI love being a therapist and being able to help people grow and thrive in their lives. I have been told by many clients that I am calm, patient, easy to talk to, non judgmental and able to just \u0022be there\u0022 in the space that they find themselves in at that time. I encourage and like feedback as it helps us make the most of the time we have together. I tailor my approach to your unique situation and needs and honor and highly value the connection between therapist and client. It is your journey and I want you to feel safe and comfortable with me in this process.\r\n\r\nIn what ways have your personal experiences influenced your work with your clients?\r\n\r\nStarting therapy with a stranger is not easy and many wonder if the therapist will understand and \u201cget\u201d them. Being a living and breathing human just like you, I\u2019ve experienced the both the joys and trauma of life and everything in between. And there is nothing that you could say or tell me that would shock me. I have also found that humor in the right circumstances can be very cathartic. Even though we\u2019ve not encountered the exact same situations, I strive to understand and empathize with your unique life struggles. I believe humans are resilient but we sometimes get lost and feel empty and alone. I\u2019m here to be your guide and help you make sense of the things in your life holding you back and assist you in learning skills that can help you become the person you want to be. I\u2019m also an introvert and highly sensitive person and view these traits as one of life\u2019s most precious gifts. I honor and use these gifts to listen openly and connect easily with clients in a genuine and empathetic way.\r\n\r\nHow do you determine therapy goals with clients? What does that process look like?\r\n\r\nDefining and setting goals is something that begins as soon as we meet each other for the first time. We will collaborate together and discuss what you would like to change or improve in your life during the first session. I will look at the presenting issues that you bring but also your history and physical, emotional and spiritual wellness. Then we will start identifying specific goals and objectives. As our work progresses I will check in with you about your goals and ask for feedback about how you think the therapy is going for you. I often use the \u0022miracle question\u0022 which asks \u0022if you were to wake up tomorrow and all your problems were solved, what would your life look like\u0022? This helps you visualize specific goals and objectives to work on to get to that improved image of yourself.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you on your therapy journey!

I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) licensed in the States of California, Oregon and Washington. I attended the University of California, Berkeley and received Masters in Social Work (MSW) and Public Health (MPH) and have had over 10 years of experience providing counseling to the medically sick, terminally ill, the bereaved, veterans and many others.  I am experienced in and often use Dialectical Behavioral therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavioral therapy (CBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and I use a Humanistic approach that is Solution-Focused. These are techniques and approaches that you can Google to learn more about me but they alone may not tell you if you and I will work well together. \r\n\r\nBeyond the technical trainings and skills, here is who I am. \r\n\r\nI believe in therapy. I believe the statement that \u201cPeople don\u2019t care how much you know until they know how much you care\u201d. Practicing therapy gives me the opportunity and joy of practicing caring in a professional and skilled way. The therapy outcomes research bears this out: Across all treatment approaches, the most important correlates of positive therapy outcomes are: 1. Therapist characteristics (empathy, warmth, genuineness) 2. Alliance between therapist and client 3.

My name is Andrea. I\u0027m a Mental Health Counselor licensed in Massachusetts and Nebraska with 10 years experience as a therapist. I began my career working in an inpatient dual diagnosis unit. I simultaneously worked as a therapist for the federal government proving therapy to men and women looking for guidance on making good life decisions. For several years, I ran an outpatient clinic and was fortunate enough to work with clients ranging in age from 5-68. Needless to say, my experience as a therapist has been vast and includes people from all walks of life! \r\n\r\nFor the entirety of my career, I\u0027ve done initial evaluations for all of my clients, in addition to clients being seen by other therapists. This has given me the opportunity to learn about and work with an array of clients with many different presenting problems. Some of specialties include depression, anxiety, self esteem, communication issues, and relationship problems. In addition to these specialties, I have worked with many people who have suffered traumas due to abuse or other factors. \r\n\r\nMy counseling style is collaborative. It\u0027s important to me that the people I work with feel like they\u0027re being heard and that therapy is being tailored to their needs. I do not believe that therapy is a one size fits all so I will work hard to figure out what works best for you instead of providing generic responses and interventions. You can expect that I will be honest, friendly, and supportive during our time together. I hope to provide a judgement free zone where you feel able to share whatever is on your mind, no matter how embarrassing or uncomfortable. I use cognitive behavioral approaches but I will tailor my approach to meet your needs so there is a greater change of success. \r\n\r\nI have been providing online therapy for some time and find that this is the best way to provide access to mental health for everyone. I have found that this platform allows people to share their thoughts, reflect, and receive fast responses that just isn\u0027t possible with traditional face to face therapy.

After completion of my education I began my clinical work splitting time between a trauma informed clinic and a public school in the inner city.  Working with families from many different cultural backgrounds, my counseling style constantly had to evolve and change to meet the need.  I always have an emphasis on treating the family when possible and truly enjoyed that type of work when given the opportunity.  As I gained more experience I turned more focus toward drugs use , trying to gain empathy and understanding to better treat those I served.  Putting trauma and substance use at the forefront of my treatment approach I was then able to work on and refine other areas that are connected.  Providing support and encouragement to parents that may be struggling, coping with anxiety or even bolstering self esteem are all areas that I have experience with as well as depression, body image, self-harm, bullying, defiance, attention impairment and grief.  I am constantly attending training\u0027s to increase my  skills and interventions so that I can stay current with new and effective methods of therapy.  Outside of work, I am a husband and father to three young girls.  Being a parent is extremely difficult but truly rewarding.  Most of my free time is spent with my children, coloring, reading or looking for bugs.  \r\nMy approach is calm, attentive and supportive.

Many of us are passive biographers, believing that our book is already written, and that the ending is set in stone. Here\u0027s the secret: Our lives are not linear, and we have the power to edit our narrative at any--and every--moment. While we cannot change our past, we can learn to change our perspective of it.

I will support you to find the strength and motivation that will allow you to be more open and committed to making the changes you desire. In our time together, we will explore the full range of your emotions, including feelings that you may not be aware of--yet!

As such, I am excited to work together with all of my clients to assist them in overcoming their issues. This includes helping to empower them to be able to overcome any similar issues in the future. I also know counseling can be an intimidating process. This is especially so when being faced with sharing deeply personal things over the internet. As your counselor, I will put a conscious effort into creating a safe and welcoming therapeutic environment. I am always open for questions, comments or concerns and will work hard to make this a smooth and comfortable process.\r\n\r\nI graduated from my Masters program in 2013 and have since been working in various fields of counseling. I have specific experience within domestic violence, private practices, inpatient drug and alcohol rehab, and employee assistance programs.

I believe the therapeutic relationship we create is one of the most important components of a successful outcome.  I strive to make people feel comfortable by remaining open minded, non-judgemental and genuine. I offer a strength based approach (utilizing DBT, Mindfulness, CBT and Solution Focused Therapy) to the people I work with and the situations they are dealing with because I strongly believe every individual has the capability to promote healthy change in their lives when they are ready and willing.  Life is already hectic with never ending to-do lists and responsibilities that it can be easy to fall out of balance and begin to feel overwhelmed by it all.  I feel confident that we can problem solve ways to help you regain that balance.  I take a holistic approach to assessing the areas of your life that are causing the imbalances and help you develop ways to either cope with the circumstances or find other solutions to help alleviate suffering.  I am a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in the state of California and have been working in the mental health field since 2000.  I have been licensed since 2011 and before that worked as a behavior specialist .  Most of my career has been working in the school system, juvenile detention centers and residential facilities for youth removed from their homes.  I have worked extensively with children, adolescents and their parents.  I am also passionate about the mind, body and soul connection and am constantly researching and learning new ways to improve this important connection within myself so that I can share insights and knowledge with others looking to do so as well. \r\n\r\nImportant:  Please Read\r\nI do work a full time job Monday-Friday from 8am-4pm Pacific Standard Time and will therefore be unavailable during those hours to respond.  I have designated virtual office hours so that you will know when I am available online to either respond to messages you have sent me, or to provide a Live session (message chat, video, or phone call) if requested.  Response time to messages varies Monday-Friday depending on when the message was sent and when my online office hours are that day.  Typically response times can range from within the hour to 36 hours but could be up to 48 hours depending on the number and length of the messages received.  It is very important to me to put together a thoughtful response rather than a rushed one, so thank you in advance for your understanding and patience.  \r\n\r\nBetterhelp Virtual Therapy Office Hours \r\nCurrently, Scheduled on an individual basis\r\n*I am not currently accepting new clients\r\n\r\n\r\n* Please keep in mind I am not typically available on the weekends but you are still free to send me messages as often as you need over the weekend and I will follow up with you on Monday during my office hours.  \r\n\r\nEffective 11\/7\/2018, therapy appointments will be scheduled as follows:\r\n30 minute appointments are actually 25 minute sessions, allowing for 5 minutes to write a note or take a quick break in between sessions. \r\n60 minute appointments are actually 50 minute sessions (just like if you were to attend a therapy session in person), allowing for 10 minutes to write a note or take a quick break in between sessions. \r\n\r\nBetterhelp is still working on making changes to allow for sessions to be booked in hour blocks rather than 30 minute blocks.  This will certainly help prevent people being able to book 30 minute blocks back to back, especially when they wanted a full hour and I can\u2019t always get into the system quickly enough to block the 30 minutes following the scheduled time to guarantee an hour session.  Please note this does happen from time to time and I do my best to avoid disrupting everyone\u0027s schedule to accommodate needs.  \r\n\r\nI encourage you all to try and set up regular session times each week to ensure you have access to services more regular.  While I do my best to accommodate last minute changes or requests, I also know I am not always able to do so and want to make sure you are getting what you need without a gap in being seen regularly.  \r\n\r\nI have been working with Betterhelp now for over a year and a half during which time I have been evaluating my own habits and making efforts to improve my own self-care so that I can always be my most optimal to best serve you all.  In that process I have come up with some ways to have more effective balance in responding to messages each day without sacrificing my own self-care time.  If we have a regular scheduled therapy session that week, I will be responding to additional messages within approximately 48 hours.  If we don\u2019t have a therapy session scheduled that week, I will be responding to messages within approximately 24 hours.  This will ensure that my time is being given to each of you more equally but also taking into consideration individual needs.  Any messages received after 1pm on Friday, or Saturday and Sunday will be responded to on Monday during my online hours (6:00-9:30PM PST).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","full_name":"Jennifer Boyea","gender":"female","credentials":["LMFT"],"state":"California","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":false,"specialties":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Self esteem","Depression","Coping with life changes","Addictions","LGBT","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Sleeping disorders","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder","ADHD"],"languages":["English"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":"1851437578","counselor_of_color":false,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Stress, Anxiety","Relationship issues","Self esteem","Depression","Coping with life changes"],"secondary":["Addictions","LGBT","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Grief","Intimacy-related issues","Sleeping disorders","Parenting issues","Anger management","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder","ADHD"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LMFT","state":"California","country":"United States","number":"50099","expires_at":"2025-03-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"CA LMFT 50099"},{"id":2672,"slug":"cheryl-salas","photo_url":"\/\/d3ez4in977nymc.cloudfront.net\/avatars\/76e657f4681614ebb5350c75f2e3b29e.jpg","years_experience":18,"description":"I am a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist with over 20 years of experience working with couples, individuals, families and groups in both inpatient and outpatient settings.

And talking helps. My top work entails...\n\n\u0022Positive Mental Health, Understanding Ourselves\u0022 - I work closely with clients going through Depression, Anxiety, and Trauma. Together we discuss the memories and feelings that you\u0027re struggling with and figure out healthy ways to talk and cope. Plus, lots of conversation on creating healthy habits, seeing a doctor, when medication is necessary, and how to sustain peace, calm, and balance inside and out.\n\n\u0022Situational Depression and Anxiety\u0022 - 2020 and the past year has put all of us in different places and situations than expected. This is where you share with me what is going on in your life triggering difficulty in coping with current circumstances. I do mental health assessments, and together we discuss what you\u0027re going through, how to express your feelings, and how to lift your mood and focus on thoughts, actions, and behaviors despite how life unfolds. You will learn resilience... essentially how to respond versus react and follow your life values and make decisions accordingly.\n\n\u0022Couples Therapy for One\u0022 - I am a big proponent to healing relationships if that is a part of your goals. I work with *individuals* as they work to better their relationships or move through relationship conflict, breakup, or even divorce.  Some call it \n\n\u0022Professional Growth\/Entrepreneur Mental Health\u0022 - I work with those struggling through Stress and Burnout. Particularly to those who are entrepreneurs, business owners, and high achieving professionals facing unique challenges of that lifestyle. Also, this is ideal for those in the helping and caregiving professions such as nurses, therapists, counselors, and first responders.\n\n\u0022Health Focused\u0022 - Also, I am a medical family therapist. I can talk with you about your chronic pain and\/or illness struggles along with medical facets to your diagnosis, treatment and recovery. \n\nOverall, I talk with you about whatever matters most to you. I support those who are ready for change.\n\n*MORE ABOUT ME:* I believe mindfulness and self-care are powerful and freeing. I practice solution focused, person-centered, positive psychology everyday. I am enthralled with the stars (of the sky), live for music and travel, and frequently am found taking walks in the South Florida sunshine. In the meantime, I love working with my clients, and supporting them through growth.

Although I was born and raised in California, my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees - M.Ed and Ph.D. - alma maters are from universities in Virginia. You can ask me why I moved from California to Virginia, and hopefully I will have constructed a truthful answer that is as intriguing as a George RR Martin novel.\r\n\r\nSimilar to my training, my therapeutic approach is multi-faceted, as I have several areas of expertise within clinical psychology. I\u0027ve spent considerable time working with children and adolescents (spanning all ranges of development) on emotional and behavioral concerns at home and at school. From this, I developed a passion for working with families and understanding family conflict, whether I was working with one or more partners in a parenting relationship (bio, step or multigenerational) and\/or romantic relationship.  The increase of mental health awareness has led more young-to-middle aged adults to seek therapy with me, looking for help to cope with recent diagnoses or long-standing struggles with anxiety, depression, self-confidence, life transitions, job satisfaction, identity exploration and general guidance toward life satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWherever I practice, my clients are my guests. I am welcoming you into a safe space, a second home. As my guest, you will have a comforting environment where you can share your most vulnerable moments openly and without judgment. Together, we will identify and address your deepest concerns.

I also work with clients who have experienced traumatic life situations such as physical trauma and\/ or emotional abuse.\r\n\r\nMy counseling style is warm and interactive. I believe in treating anyone with respect, sensitivity, and compassion, and I don\u0027t believe in stigmatizing labels. My approach combines cognitive-behavioral, mindfulness, humanistic,and dialectical behavior therapy . I will tailor our dialog and treatment plan to meet your unique and specific needs.\r\n\r\nIt takes courage to seek for a more fulfilling and happier life and to take the first steps towards a change. If you are ready to take that step I am here to support and empower you.\r\n\r\nI look forward to working with you!","full_name":"Nita Prasad","gender":"female","credentials":["MS","LMFT"],"state":"California","country":"United States","accepting_international_clients":false,"specialties":["Addictions","Relationship issues","Parenting issues","Depression","Stress, Anxiety","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Grief","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder"],"languages":["English","Hindi"],"additional_focus_areas":[],"clinical_approaches":[],"npi_number":null,"counselor_of_color":true,"is_accepting_clients":false,"specialties_with_level":{"featured":["Addictions","Relationship issues","Parenting issues","Depression"],"secondary":["Stress, Anxiety","Family conflicts","Trauma and abuse","Grief","Anger management","Self esteem","Career difficulties","Bipolar disorder"]},"licenses":[{"type":"LMFT","state":"California","country":"United States","number":"43500","expires_at":"2024-01-31"}],"pretty_license_text":"CA LMFT 43500"}]},"status":"success"}
